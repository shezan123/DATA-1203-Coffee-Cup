Post data analysis, a dashboard was created depicting the performance of each product sold by the company. The parameters measured in our analysis include the net sales, gross profit and cost of goods sold. It is to be noted that the performance of products in different markets of Canada varies and must be taken into consideration in the sales and inventory plan for 2020. We must also look into the seasonality of sales in different products to optimize our product inventory.

### Data Analysis

The dataset Coffee_Cup_Data.xlsx has 20 columns and 4248 entries of sales and product data of The Coffee Cup. In the exploratory data analysis conducted using python, we found that the data contained entries from the years 2012,2018 and 2019. Since our focus was only on 2019, we filtered the data for this year. After the EDA, we uploaded the cleaned data to Tableau and conducted further analysis. We computed the total sales and net profit for every market for the year.
Consequently, a graph was plotted to depict the monthly sales numbers. Furthermore, for a better understanding of changes in values of sales, we calculated the sales growth percentage for every month in 2019. Then we study the sales, profit, and cost of goods sold for each product sold by the company. In addition to this, a table was created to represent the top 10 performing stores by sales. A global filter was designed to navigate this dashboard through various markets and Canada.
